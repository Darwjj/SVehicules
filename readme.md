Welcome to SVehicules S.L.

On our website, you can find every luxury car you desire in your home's comfort.

On our main page, you can find a brief resume of our company, different types of vehicles you rent or buy, principal locations, some of the most typical questions we have every day, and various references that make us who we are as a company.

There is another page called Buy/Rent. Where you can find the cars that you are looking for. Also, under every vehicle's description, you can find the option "Contact." It takes you to the other page, called Contact.

On the Contact page, you must fill out the form with your name, phone number, email, and the car model you are looking for. After this process, we will receive an email with all your details, and then we can start working on giving you the best price you can find.

On our last page, you can find the history behind this company and some of our principal members that make the company possible.

**This website is a simple, functional demo of a possible dealership company for luxury cars.**

To recreate this specific website, I based my idea on two specific websites, such as https://www.zoopla.co.uk and https://www.jamesedition.com/cars.

## Some of the pages that I used to develop this website are:

- https://www.w3schools.com (Sections, container, grid, fix sizes, form, search bar implementation and question expansion)
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRt28rv6SW8&list=PLZZIgjlKiaIOhuqRVETS_M14lypE4jLOl (How to use IconScout)
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BATVa4vGZto (How To Add Icons on HTML Website)
- https://unsplash.com (Images without copyright "free")
- https://medium.com/@shraddharao_/how-to-create-a-dynamic-form-using-javascript-dfd4821707f0 (How to create a form in HTML and JavaScript)
- https://www.codewithrandom.com/2023/03/04/social-media-icons-html-and-css-hover-icons-animation-codewithrandom/ (How to do social media icons with animation)
- Front-End Web Development. Learning materials (How to create a search bar with images)
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tphDji-XZCE (Idea of how I can do slider with buttons next and previous)
